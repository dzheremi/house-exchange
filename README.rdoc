== README

Model files have been created:

* User
* Property
* PropertyFeature
* PropertyImage
* Listing

View files have been created for registration and login, see ./app/views/authentication/ - login.html.erb and register.html.erb.

When referencing a new controller function, please add it to the routes config file, unless it is not called directly by a user.

If you're getting any weird errors, run "service apache2 restart" as root - this fixes the node.js problems.
