# House Exchange

*This is a university submission from a software engineering unit from 2015*

I was required to create a simple AirBnb style platform in a framework of my choice.

I was somewhat familiar with Ruby on Rails and decided to run with it.

The application is a MPA (multi-page application) with a set of basic unit and functional tests.
